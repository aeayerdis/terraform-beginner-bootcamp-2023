        <p>Soccer, known as football outside North America, is more than just a game. It's a global celebration, a unifying force that bridges cultures, languages, and beliefs.</p>

        <img  src="/assets/soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer Game" class="soccer-img">

        <p>The pitch becomes a stage where magic happens, where players dance with the ball at their feet, crafting narratives of victories, losses, and unforgettable moments.</p>

            "Some people believe football is a matter of life and death. I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that." - Bill Shankly
        </div>

        <p>Every pass, every goal, every save, tells a story. The roar of the crowd, the unity in their chants, and the passion in every kick remind us of why soccer is the world's most beloved sport.</p>
